                We follow a specific method to solve every problem
                building a system to solve a problem using an intelligent system toolkit.                 
                Our approach allows us to build complex and flexible solutions for complex 
                hierarchical systems that operate over a long period of time.                
                We are a company that is not project-oriented. 
                For all active developments a working group is recruited, which implements 
                the project. The experience of the company is made up of employees with more
                than 50 years of experience in applied scientific, technical and business projects.</p>

                            Installation is simple and can be done within a few hours.

                            It takes between three to four weeks for <span class="bolder">BEPIPE</span> to achieve its full effect - depending on the length of the cabling and the number of branches.

                        <p>System consists of four insulated tanks containing mineral substances that are harmless to the environment. Copper cables connect these to each phase of the AC network, a single pole after the transformer. Likewise, with the neutral conductor. This means there is no galvanic connection to the next higher voltage level. Thus, no free electrons flow back to the power source.
                            A chemical reaction begins as soon as alternating current flows through the containers. Large quantities of electrons are released. The concentration increases constantly. If more free electrons are now formed than circulatein the consumer network, they automatically flow into the line network. And in the process, they not only push the electrons ahead of them but also, to put it simply, flood the resistors.
                            The result: electrical conductivity increases, the resistance of all conductors in the consumer network reduces, and thus power consumption is lowered.</p>
